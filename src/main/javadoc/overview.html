  <BODY>
    MYRA is a collection of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms for the data mining
    classification task. It includes popular rule induction and decision tree induction algorithms.
    The algorithms are ready to be used from the command line or can be easily called from your own
    Java code. They are build using a modular architecture, so they can be easily extended to
    incorporate different procedures and/or use different parameter values.
